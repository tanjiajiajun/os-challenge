# Assignment 7 - The Great Firewall of Santa Cruz: Bloom Filters, Binary Trees and Hash Tables


This program will make sure that the citizens of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Santa Cruz will follow the new form of speaking, newspeak. This will be done through banning words labeled as badthink, and updating words from a list of oldspeak to the fresh and reviving newspeak. This will be carried out using the Bloom filter, Binary Tree, and Hash table ADTs.
